# Dynamic-Arrays-and-Template-Arrays
So, guys basically this rep revolves around how to dynamically allocate arrays and how to pass them into functions using pointers
.(Every array is a pointer and every pointer is an array)
Also, it shows how to use Class Arrays or known as THE TEMPLATE ARRAYS.........
Task one deals with the insertion of elements of arrays and deleting particuor element of the array
TASK 2 will check whether the added array is an set ot not and if not...it will ask for the inout again...
Task 3 will give you the union of the entered SETS......
Task 4 will give you the intersection of the sets...
Task 5 will be of subraction of the Set B from A or SET A - SET B
Task 6 will be of Compliment
and lastly, MY SUBRACTION is an easier version of task 5 but only done dynamically...
and YEs, folks... from TASK 2 to TASK 6....every thing is done in two ways...by that I mean by dynamic allocation and CLASS ARRAYS
I have commented out one thing out of two beacause I am lazy and I dont want to create more cpp file...Hope u like it........
